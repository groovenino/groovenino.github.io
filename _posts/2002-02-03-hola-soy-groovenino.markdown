Good Afternoon. Under the moniker of `Groove Niño`, I produce music using electronic middles, preferentially software, because it is the cheapest way to get the job done. I live in Chile, a wealthy country with absurd income inequality. I am studying classical music performance at Universidad Catolica de Chile; therefore, there is not so much money to expend on gear. I love grooveboxes, which explain the use of "Groove" as part of my name and Niño because I am probably a childish person.
